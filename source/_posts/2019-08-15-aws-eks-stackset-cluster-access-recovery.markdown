Kubernetes is contagious and nowadays hard to ignore. So we decided to look into EKS to see how it would work for
our microservice suite. As of today, there are 2 ways of creating (official) an EKS cluster: `eksctl` via CLI or
point and click through the Web-UI.

We have multiple accounts and use services in multiple regions, so I developed a custom CloudFormation template to
build our EKS cluster with StackSets. While this worked perfectly, I found an issue of not being able to access the
cluster at all.

<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html#unauthorized" target="_blank">It turned out to be perfectly normal</a>,
since when an Amazon EKS cluster is created, the IAM entity (user or role) that creates the cluster is added to the
Kubernetes RBAC authorization table as the administrator _(with system:master permissions)_. Initially, only that IAM
user (initiated the cluster creation) can make calls to the Kubernetes API server using `kubectl`.

## About StackSets

<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html" target="_blank">The basics of StackSets,</a>
is that you create a role **AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole** on your **MASTER** account (where the StackSet
is launched from) and a role **AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole** on your **TARGET** account(s) where StackSets
will manage CloudFormation stacks for you.

## Assume role setup

So in this case, you need to make sure that your IAM user entity can assume (temporarily) the **AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole**.
This can be done multiple ways, but the easiest would be to create a TEMP group, attach an inline policy to it and at
completion, make your IAM user member of this TEMP group.

The inline policy for your TEMP group:

``` json
{
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Action": [
              "sts:AssumeRole"
            ],
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole",
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
          }
        ]
}
```

The `<123456789100>` number is YOUR target account ID where the EKS cluster is created.

Create a TEMP AWS config entry:

``` bash
$ vim ~/.aws/config

[profile eks-temp]
region = eu-central-1
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole
source_profile = <your_normal_iam_profile_name>
``` 

Test your assume role before proceeding:

``` bash
$ aws --profile eks-temp sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole --role-session-name test
```

## Update Kubernetes RBAC

<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html" target="_blank">Get the ConfigMap template</a> from AWS:

``` bash
$ curl -o aws-auth-cm.yaml https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation/2019-02-11/aws-auth-cm.yaml
```

Edit it:

``` YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: aws-auth
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  mapRoles: |
    - rolearn: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/StackSet-EKS-c4c34dcd-45as-11-NodeInstanceRole-34F45DD54RSKK
      username: system:node:{{EC2PrivateDNSName}}
      groups:
        - system:bootstrappers
        - system:nodes
    - rolearn: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/Administrator
      username: eks-admins
      groups:
        - system:masters 
```

The first element of the `mapRoles` array was added by AWS during cluster creation, we just need to extend it
and add our required access details. In my case a special role `Administrator` that only certain users
can assume, but <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html" target="_blank">you could also add IAM user arn.</a>

When ready, get a copy of your cluster config then update the cluster:

``` bash
$ aws --profile <your profile> --region eu-central-1 eks update-kubeconfig --name <eks cluster name you created>
$ kubectl apply -f aws-auth-cm.yaml
```

From this point on, your normal IAM user profile should be able to access the cluster:

``` bash
$ kubectl get svc
$ kubectl describe configmap -n kube-system aws-auth
$ kubectl get namespace
$ kubectl get nodes
```

## Clean up

Do not forget to remove the TEMP group and the TEMP AWS config profile at completion.
